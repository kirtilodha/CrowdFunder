In order to get investments , the visit sites that allow contibutors from all over the globe to invest in their project but these sites are centralized so they are not safe and they donâ€™t protect the contributors from malacious and fraud. This application is decentralised and provide transparency all over. It allows one person to ask for donations and other contributors can donate and approve the investment if valid.
